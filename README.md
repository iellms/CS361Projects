# CS361 Projects Repository

## Welcome to Object Oriented Design with Ian Ellmer as your Groupmate!

- My plan is to add people to this repo as needed and then we can use it to make sure everyone has a copy of the code that they can run on their own machine.
- If you don't know github very well, using the online version should make enough sense and many IDE's, like VSCode, have extensions that can have allow you to easily pull, push, merge, and commit.
- I will remove your edit access at the end of every project so that way I have control over my old code and please don't edit old projects, that will make me mad.
- Unless Dale tells me to make it private, I plan to keep this repo public at all times so you can look back to my old code whenever you want, but please be responsible and don't look at any new code, as that is cheating.
- Go Mules and let's crush these projects!
