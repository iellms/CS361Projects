# CS361 Projects Repository
Welcome to Object Oriented Design with Ian Ellmer as your Groupmate!

## Expectations of use
- My plan is to add people to this repo as needed and then we can use it to make sure everyone has a copy of the code that they can run on their own machine.
- If you don't know github very well, using the online version should make enough sense and many IDE's, like VSCode, have extensions that can have allow you to easily pull, push, merge, and commit.
- I will remove your edit access at the end of every project so that way I have control over my old code and please don't edit old projects, that will make me mad.
- Unless Dale tells me to make it private, I plan to keep this repo public at all times so you can look back to my old code whenever you want, but please be responsible and don't look at any new code, as that is cheating.
- Go Mules and let's crush these projects!

## UPDATES:
Everything went really well so far with projects, but here are a few tips I learned to make this run smoothly for all.
1. Make sure you commit frequently so your group members know you are actively working.
2. Don't forget to pull down the latest version before adding things to the code (I did this once and it was a headache figuring out what went missing).
3. Email is a great way to communicate, don't be afraid to take advantage of that.
4. Keep everything in the designated project folder, including the writeup if we decide to use markdown again.
5. Don't change the name of any package declaration or folder.  This code is designed to run from the repository with no edits needed, so if you have the entire repo on your machine, you shouldn't have to change even one character of code to make it work.
6. Use an IDE that allows you to integrate Github easily (Visual Studio Code is a good example of this).  It makes pulling, pushing, and committing so much easier.
